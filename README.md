# Supernote blank page templates

On finding that my old Supernote Nomad templates were no good for the Supernote Manta, and not finding what I needed online, I decided to create my own.  These templates are created with a ruby script that uses the ruby [cairo](https://github.com/rcairo/rcairo) gem.

The script currently generates files optimised for the Supernote Manta (1920 * 2560) and Nomad (1404 x 1872).

The templates are generated in a range of sizes from 2mm spacing to 10mm spacing.

## Development notes
This is in no way production quality code, don't judge me on it.
